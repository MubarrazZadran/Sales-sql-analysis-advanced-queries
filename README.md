Advanced SQL Challenges: Sales Data Analysis

This repository contains 20 advanced SQL queries solved using a realistic sales dataset with a star schema structure. This project aims to demonstrate proficiency in SQL across aggregation, window functions, joins, filtering, and anomaly detection.

Dataset Overview

- fact_sales: Contains 5,000+ transaction records with product quantity, sales amount, and purchase dates.
- dim_customers: Customer details including region and email.
- dim_products: Product information including category and price.
- dim_regions: Regional data for customer segmentation.
